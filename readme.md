## Organization of the Paper on Land and Domain Rights (üìú)

### Introduction: {#intro}

We aim to outline the structure of the paper governing land and domain legislation ([paper_in_question](Decret-No-87-271.pdf)) in Senegal. The foreword is written by **Moustapha Ngaid√©**, Doctor of Public Law, and the preface by **Abdoulaye Dieye**, Lecturer in the Public Law Department, both affiliated with the Faculty of Political and Legal Sciences at Cheikh Anta Diop University in Dakar. The authors are not explicitly named, but the document was completed with contributions from magistrates of the Supreme Court of Senegal.

The land rights document is divided into **three main sections**, a fourth section on land title expropriation, and appendices. For details on the three main sections, see: [land_rights](https://keurcity.com/domaine-national-et-domaine-public-senegal/). The <i style='color:chocolate'>sections</i> are as follows (excluding preface, foreword, table of contents, and index):

- <i style='color:chocolate'>National Domain</i>  
- <i style='color:chocolate'>State Domain</i>  
- <i style='color:chocolate'>Privately Held Titles</i>  
- <i style='color:chocolate'>Expropriation for Public Utility</i>  
- <i style='color:chocolate'>Appendices</i>  

The preface also defines these sections.

### Key Term Definitions üîë: {#definition}

#### Law: {#loi}  
A **law** is a binding system of rules established by a governing authority, enacted through formal legislative processes. It defines rights, obligations, and prohibitions for individuals and entities.

#### Decree: {#decret}  
A **decree** is a formal executive order with legal force, used to implement laws through detailed regulations or procedures.

#### Ministerial Order: {#arrete}  
A **ministerial order** is an administrative decision by a minister, addressing specific matters within their jurisdiction (e.g., urban planning, environment). It has narrower scope than laws/decrees.

---

### General Principle ü™∂: {#principe}  
Each section contains **laws** (see [Law](#loi)), which may include **decrees** (see [Decree](#decret)). Decrees can also stand independently. Every decree begins with a **first article** enacting an executive decision, followed by additional articles. Content formats include tables, paragraphs, or lists. We will later address converting <i style='color:chocolate'>article content</i> into database-storable text. Articles are dated according to their parent law/decree.  

---

### Exceptions ‚ùó: {#exception}  
- An article may lack content and only include <i style='color:chocolate'>a parenthetical citation of a law</i>.  
- A law may directly contain articles without decrees.  
---

### Supplements ‚ûï: {#supplement}

- Laws or decrees may be subdivided into **parts**, **chapters**, **titles**, **sub-titles**, **books**, **sections**, or **sub-sections**, as shown in the document‚Äôs table of contents. The following general hierarchy applies to laws/decrees:  
  ```  
  ‚û°Ô∏è <i style='color:chocolate'>Part</i> üõë  
    ‚û°Ô∏è <i style='color:chocolate'>Book</i> üõë  
      ‚û°Ô∏è <i style='color:chocolate'>Title</i> üõë  
        ‚û°Ô∏è <i style='color:chocolate'>Sub-Title</i>  
          ‚û°Ô∏è <i style='color:chocolate'>Chapter</i>  
            ‚û°Ô∏è <i style='color:chocolate'>Section</i>  
              ‚û°Ô∏è <i style='color:chocolate'>Sub-Section</i>  
  ```  
  The üõë emoji marks subdivisions that may not appear in the hierarchy. Sub-titles depend on Titles, Sections on Chapters, and Sub-Sections on Sections.  

- <i style='color:red'>For decrees related to rental price scales:  
  - **Part 1**: Titles subdivided by communes/territories within a specific region.  
  - **Part 2**: Titles subdivided into alphanumeric categories, ending with cross-reference tables showing rates for categories/regions.  
  Two decrees fall under this framework: the first governs occupancy of state-owned immovable property, and the second applies to land (vacant or developed).</i>  

- Articles are <i style='color:chocolate'>sequentially numbered</i> within laws/decrees and may <i style='color:chocolate'>reference other articles, laws, or decrees</i>.  
- Articles may include <i style='color:chocolate'>titles</i>, similar to subdivisions.  
- Articles may be prefixed with **L.** or **R.**:  
  - **L.**: In French legislative context, "L" in "Article L. 1" refers to the **legislative section**.  
    - <i style='color:chocolate'>"L"</i> denotes provisions established by the legislature.  
    - The number after "L" (e.g., "1" in "Article L. 1") indicates the <i style='color:chocolate'>specific article number</i> within the law/decree.  
    - Example: "Article L. 1" is the first article in a legislative section, followed sequentially by L. 2, L. 3, etc.  
  - **R.**: In French regulatory context, "R" in "Article R. 1" refers to the **regulatory section**.  
    - <i style='color:chocolate'>"R"</i> denotes provisions established by governmental/administrative authorities.  
    - The number after "R" (e.g., "1" in "Article R. 1") indicates the <i style='color:chocolate'>specific article number</i> within the regulatory section.  
    - Example: "Article R. 1" is the first article in a regulatory section, followed by R. 2, R. 3, etc.  

- Decrees may include <i style='color:chocolate'>annexes referenced in their articles</i>.  
- Laws/decrees may be <i style='color:chocolate'>excerpts</i> from original versions, marked as "(Extrait)".  
- Appendices contain:  
  - The document‚Äôs sole <i style='color:chocolate'>ministerial order</i> (see [Ministerial Order](#arrete)).  
  - An excerpt from the <i style='color:chocolate'>1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen</i> ([definition](https://gallica.bnf.fr/essentiels/repere/declaration-droits-homme-1789), [articles](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/contenu/menu/droit-national-en-vigueur/constitution/declaration-des-droits-de-l-homme-et-du-citoyen-de-1789)).  
### <i style='color:chocolate'>Numbering of Laws and Decrees</i> üî¢ :{#numerotation}

- Laws and decrees are commonly numbered for several reasons:

    1. **Identification and Referencing**: Numbers allow unique identification of each law/decree, facilitating precise referencing in legal documents, media, or other contexts.  

    2. **Organization and Classification**: Numbering enables systematic organization, simplifying navigation and comprehension of legal texts, especially when consulting multiple related articles/decrees.  

    3. **Tracking History and Amendments**: Numbers help trace the legislative history of laws/decrees and monitor changes over time, making it easier to identify previous versions and legal evolution.  

    4. **Clarity and Uniformity**: A consistent numbering system enhances clarity and reduces ambiguity in legal interpretation.  

---

### Senegal‚Äôs Numbering System (Aligned with France)  

1. **Laws**:  
   - Identified by a unique number assigned upon parliamentary adoption.  
   - Format: **Year of adoption** + **sequential number**.  
     - Example: *Law No. 2019-1234* = 1234th law adopted in 2019.  

2. **Decrees**:  
   - Identified by a unique number assigned upon governmental promulgation.  
   - Format: **Year of promulgation** + **sequential number**.  
     - Example: *Decree No. 2020-567* = 567th decree promulgated in 2020.  

This system ensures precise identification, streamlined referencing, and efficient application of legislative/regulatory texts in Senegal‚Äôs legal framework.  
### Attributes of an Article üî∂: {#attributs}

Terms highlighted in <i style='color:chocolate'>chocolate</i> define key concepts for a land law article. Analyzing these terms reveals the following attributes:

### Rental Price Rate Schedules {#rate-schedules}

Article 1 of Decree No. 2010-400 on rental price schedules for <i style='color:chocolate'>state-owned real estate properties</i> and Decree No. 2010-439 on rental prices for <i style='color:chocolate'>land (vacant or built)</i> are structured differently from other articles. Both decrees share a similar framework.

#### Structure of Both Decrees üèòÔ∏è {#rate-config}

Each decree contains two parts:

1. **Part 1**: Focuses on <i style='color:chocolate'>the square meter value of vacant land</i>, subdivided into titles assigned to <i style='color:chocolate'>specific regions of Senegal</i>. For each region, there may be multiple <i style='color:chocolate'>localities</i> and <i style='color:chocolate'>land types</i>, followed by rate schedules for zones within these localities and land types.

2. **Part 2**: Addresses <i style='color:chocolate'>the square meter value of built land</i>, divided into:
   - <i style='color:chocolate'>Premises categorization</i>: Defines categories based on <i style='color:chocolate'>housing type</i>.
   - <i style='color:chocolate'>Square meter price schedule</i>: A cross-tabulation table with rows for housing type categories and columns for regions.

#### Configuration of Article 1 on Rental Prices üî∑ {#rate-parameters}

Article 1 must be adapted differently depending on the text provided. For example:
- In Part 1, the original text of Article 1 must accompany rate schedules for zones in localities/land types.
- Definitions of categories and cross-tabulation tables require similar adaptations.

Additional attributes (based on terms highlighted in <i style='color:chocolate'>chocolate</i> in the [Structure of Both Decrees](#rate-config) subsection) beyond the general [Article Attributes](#attributs) include:

| Attribute Names                               | Type                           | Value Spaces (¬•), Regex (¬£), or Date Format (‚Ç¨) | Nullable (True/False)                   |

| Housing Type                                  | Categorical                    | {Collective Housing, Single-Family Homes, Developed Courtyards, Fences} (¬•) | True |
| Rental Price Article                          | Boolean                        | {True, False} (¬•)                                | False                                   |

### Paper Preparation for Extraction ü™µ  

The land and domain-related texts span 527 pages. Given the significant volume of documents and the varied presentation of information as one progresses through the text, we must conduct a thorough preliminary analysis (or processing) of the different sections before proceeding to the step of extracting articles and their corresponding attributes.  

We will first perform the following preliminary steps:  

- **Split the document** (based on the General Summary section) **into 8 parts** (manually, into separate PDF files):  
  - PREFACE  
  - FOREWORD  
  - Summary  
  - Part One: National Domain  
  - Part Two: State Domain  
  - Part Three: Private Domain  
  - Part Four: Expropriation for Public Utility  
  - Appendices  
  - TABLE OF CONTENTS  

- **Divide the Summary section into**:  
  - Summary of Part One: National Domain  
  - Summary of Part Two: State Domain  
  - Summary of Part Three: Private Domain  
  - Summary of Part Four: Expropriation for Public Utility  
  - Summary of Appendices  

- **Organize identified sub-sections into folders**: This involves identifying the content of laws, decrees, and orders, then structuring them into

```python
from directory_tree import display_tree

display_tree("Laws_Decrees_Orders")
```
